## Overview

The Dining Philosophers problem is a classic concurrency problem. In this project, you'll simulate philosophers who spend their time thinking and eating. The challenge lies in managing shared resources (forks) without causing deadlocks or race conditions.

## Features

- Simulation of the Dining Philosophers problem
- Handling of concurrency with threads
- Prevention of deadlocks and race conditions
- Customizable simulation parameters

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following:

- GCC or Clang (for compiling the C code)
- `make` (for building the project)
- POSIX threads (pthreads)

### Build Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rboutaik/philosophers.git
   cd philosophers
